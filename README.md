# seanofconnor.github.io

Implemented the 3 html files and one css file, the required image in an "images" directory, and this README.

I completed this lab on my own over about 4 hours, the bulk of which was spent making sure I was using git/github correctly. Have an issue because I made a github page 4 years ago on the "master" branch and I was committing my new work to "main". Copied over work to the elder "master" branch to test it live on the W3 validation site.
